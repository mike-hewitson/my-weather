# fridge controller front-end

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Run ```$ bower install``` and ```$ npm install``` to get all components.

Running this will need the REST server on port 3000, started by running:
```json-server db.json --watch``` from the json-server directory.

Run ```$ grunt``` for building and ```$ grunt serve``` for preview.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

Running ```$ grunt test``` will run the unit tests with karma.
Does not need server as the back end is mocked out.
Coverage reporting is in the build directory under /reports/coverage.

### E2E Testing

Requires the REST server on port 3000, started by running:
```$ json-server db.json --watch``` from the json-server directory.

To run the e2e tests, run in the main directory:
```$ grunt serve```

Then change directory to the tests directory and run:
```$ protractor protractor.conf.js```

### Linting

The JSHint reporting comes out from running the server
```$ grunt serve```

## Deployment

Confirm the environment constants are pointing to the right rest server. The build should bring in the production environment from production.json.

```
$ grunt build
```
Copy dist folder to server directory. Create nginx config to point at index.html in the root.

## Deployment on Heruko

Set up clean heroku application, with github deployment option.
Copy the contents of the dist folder into the github dist repo.
Copy index.php into the github dist folder as well. This is to fool heroku into treating this as a plain web app.
Push to github and open app!
